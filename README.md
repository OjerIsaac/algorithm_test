# BACKEND DEVELOPER ASSESSMENT
An algorithm test

# Test question
- Given an array, rotate the array to the right by the k steps, where k is non-negative.
sample input
array = [1,2,3], k=2 . Output = [3,2,1]
array=[] k=3 Output = []
- An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or
monotone decreasing. An array is monotone increasing if all its
elements from left to right are non-decreasing. An array is
monotone decreasing if all its elements from left to right are
non-increasing. Given an integer array return true if the given array
is monotonic, or false otherwise.
sample input
[1,2,3,4] = true;
[10,3,4,6] = false;
[9] = true
